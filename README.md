# Friend Finder
A compatibility-based Friend Finder application. This is a full-stack site that takes results from a users' survey and then compares their answer with those of other users. The app then displays the name and a picture of the user with the best overall match and stores that user's information so that they can now be presented as a match going forward. The app is deployed on heroku here -- https://secure-ridge-26423.herokuapp.com/
